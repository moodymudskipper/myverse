## Overview

Users often use the RProfile to attach the packages they often use but this
approach is not ideal as it lacks flexibility and can get in the way of reproducibility.

*{myverse}* is a fork of the *{tidyverse}* package that provides a way
to attach a predefined list of chosen packages.

You may your *.Rprofile* to set the `myverse.pkgs` option, and then `myverse::myverse_attach()`
will attach your chosen packages, explicitly by default, just like `library(tidyverse)`
does.


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("moodymudskipper/myverse")
```

## Usage

```{r}
# In RProfile (Recommended)
options(
  myverse.pkgs  = c("data.table", "zoo", "matrixStats")
)
# Then at the top of your main script
myverse::myverse_attach()
```

```{r}
# In RProfile (Recommended)
options(
  myverse.pkgs  = list(
    c("data.table", "zoo", "matrixStats"),
    muddyverse  = c("flow", "boomer", "typed", "doubt", "unglue", "dotdot", "inops")
  )
)

# attach only "muddyverse" packages
myverse::myverse_attach("muddyverse")
```

## Comparison with {tidyverse}

* The function `my_verse_attach()` is used to attach packages,
 `library(myverse)` doesn't attach packages since it would lack flexibility to
  attach a specific cluster of packages. An additional benefit is that if you
  call `myverse::myverse_attach()` without attaching *{myverse}* you won't
  pollute your workspace with other exported functions
* All {tidyverse} exported functions, with the exception of `tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()`,
  have a counterpart in {myverse}, namely in place of
  `tidyverse_conflicts()`, `tidyverse_deps()`,
  `tidyverse_packages()`,  `tidyverse_sitrep()` and
  `tidyverse_update()` we have
  `myverse_conflicts()`, `myverse_deps()`,
  `myverse_packages()`,  `myverse_sitrep()` and
  `myverse_update()`. They all get an additional `cluster` argument
* The option `"tidyverse.quiet"` has a `"myverse.quiet"` counterpart
* The code is essentially taken from tidyverse, alterations were done to
  adapt the functionalities and to remove dependencies towards tidyverse packages
