Description: Define a list of packages as options and attach them easily by attaching
    the 'myverse' package. This is arguably better than using the RProfile because
    you need to opt in in each session so this won't damage reproductibility, moreover
    this prints the list of attached packages and their versions. This is directly
    inspired by the Hadley Wickham's 'tidyverse' package and borrows some of its
    code and look.
